Flask-SQLAlchemy
================

Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for `Flask`_ that adds support for
`SQLAlchemy`_ to your application. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy
with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it
easier to accomplish common tasks.

.. _Flask: https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/
.. _SQLAlchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org


Installing
----------

Install and update using `pip`_:

.. code-block:: text

  $ pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/


A Simple Example
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///example.sqlite"

    class Base(DeclarativeBase):
      pass

    db = SQLAlchemy(app, model_class=Base)

    class User(db.Model):
        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        username: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.String, unique=True, nullable=False)

    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()

        db.session.add(User(username="example"))
        db.session.commit()

        users = db.session.execute(db.select(User)).scalars()
